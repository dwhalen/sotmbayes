<p>The SotM Randomizer is a utility to randomly generate setups for the board game, Sentinels of the Multiverse.  The Randomizer uses a statistical model to estimate game difficulty, allowing you to find a game that is correct for you.</p>

<p>The SotM Randomizer uses accumulated data from the <a href="http://greaterthangames.com/forum/topic/sentinels-statistics-project-2893"> Sentinels Statistics Project <a> as well as user game records to estimate game difficulty.  This app was inspired by Matthew Gray's naive Bayesian victory prediction system and uses a similar statistical model. </p>
